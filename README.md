# Monkey Interpreter

This repository contains my implementation of the Monkey programming language interpreter, following along with Thorsten Ball's book ["Writing an Interpreter in Go"](https://interpreterbook.com/).

## About

The Monkey programming language is a simple, C-like language designed specifically for learning how to build interpreters. This project implements a tree-walking interpreter that can execute Monkey programs.

## Running

To start the Monkey REPL:

```bash
go run main.go
```
